# Selenium
Projects with selenium
DONE:
logintoschool.py : use selenium to log into my online school and check if I am missing any assignments
amazon_scrape.py : given a search, go to each of the products and grab the reviews, then put all of them into a database.
linkedin_jobs.py : Login to Linkedin, navigate to Jobs, enter a search, and gather the results
Planned:
selenium_scrape_gui : make a gui for scraping with selenium, most likely building out amazon_scrape
use the data collected from the amazon scrape to run a sentiment analysis
